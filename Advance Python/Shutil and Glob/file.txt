Generative AI (GenAI) refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, such as text, images, music, or code, based on the data they have learned from. 
These models use techniques like deep learning and transformers to generate human-like outputs. 
GenAI is widely used in chatbots, content creation, code generation, and even image synthesis. 
Some popular GenAI tools include ChatGPT, DALLÂ·E, and MidJourney.
